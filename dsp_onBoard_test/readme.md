# About this DSP Process
Generally in main.c ; Using cmsis-dsp library.An ADC will collect 1024 bits data into an buffer by DMA in a sampling rate of 100kHz. As all the bits are transferred, an NVIC would be triggered, and restart the timmer and adc. Also, a variable called flag would be set to 1, which is used to trigger the function set inside the infinite loop in main function.  
After finishing the transfer, fft would be applied to the array, and the frequency spectrum would be found.
